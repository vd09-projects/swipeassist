        overall build (e.g., slim/average/muscular/stocky) ONLY if clearly visible, face visibility (clear/partial).

      description: >
        Only activities clearly visible (hiking, travel, gym, pets, concerts).
        Do not infer from captions or tags. If not visible, use unknown.

    - name: "photo_style_and_effort"
      description: >
        Photo composition/quality and what it suggests about how they present themselves visually
        (candid vs posed, scenic shots vs selfies). Do not infer sensitive details.

    - name: "potential_concerns"
      description: >
        Conservative, photo-based concerns only: face fully hidden, extreme blur, unsafe context, misleading edits.
        Avoid moral judgment; just describe visibility/clarity issues.

    - name: "apparent_gender"
      description: >
        Determine the apparent gender based solely on visible visual cues in the image
        (such as facial structure, body shape, hairstyle, clothing presentation, and other
        commonly associated physical traits).

        Valid outputs are:
        - "male"
        - "female"
        - "unknown"

        Rules:
        - If **exactly one clearly visible person** is present in the image, the model MUST
          choose either "male" or "female".
        - If **no person** is visible in the image, the signal MUST be "unknown".
        - If **multiple people** are visible in the image, the signal MUST be "unknown".
        - The model MUST NOT use qualifiers such as "ambiguous", "not clear", or similar.
        - The signal field MUST contain exactly one of: "male", "female", or "unknown".
